# Introduction to web APIs

## What is an API?

- **Application Programming Interface** (API) are constructs made available in programming languages to allow developers to create complex functionality more easily.

### APIs in client-side JavaScript

- They generally fall into two categories:

1. **Browser APIs** - built into the browser and able to expose data from the browser and surrounding computer environment and do useful complex things with it.
2. **Third-party APIs** are not built into the browser by default, and you generally have to retrieve their code and information from somewhere on the web.
